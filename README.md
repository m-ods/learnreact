# Learn React
One day I was tired of watching endless tutorials and just wanted to build something. This repo is a mini-site that uses components that I've built using React.

### House rules
- Document what I learn: I keep track of the new things I learn while building a component inside a comment at the bottom of the file.
- Go outside of my comfort zone
- Make it look pretty
- Have fun!
- Iterate Iterate Iterate

### Milestones
 - [x] Built my first component
 - [x] Implemented dark/light mode
 - [ ] Implement a backend
 - [x] Deploy the site on the internet (see here: https://phenomenal-narwhal-57ff2b.netlify.app/)
 - [ ] Build something (at least slightly) useful
